  * raise an exception if the URL passed in is not a unicode object nor
    ascii We can't submit a correct URL with arbitrary bytes -- we have
    to submit a utf-8 encoded unicode string. (Otherwise we'll cause
    either a rejection or a signature mismatch in the server, which is
    what has happened at SimpleGeo.) If the caller passes in non-ascii
    things in a str then it would be better for them to change their
    code to decode it to unicode before passing it in than for us to
    decode it, since they have a better chance of knowing what encoding
    it is in -- if we did it we would be guessing.
  * fix flaws pointed out by ieure, plus test failures I'm not entirely
    sure it is appropriate to allow .url and .normalized_url to be non-
    existent in addition to allowing them to be None, but I don't really
    understand the intent of the url setter.
  * Oh, after we've made sure it can be converted to unicode, just leave
    it as a unicode object after that.
  * raise more specific error message if argument to to_unicode() is
    neither unicode nor str
  * a couple of cleanups suggested by ieure in code review

  * run tests when building
  * raise exception from a test just to see if hudson is *really*
    running these tests. I don't see the test results.
  * put version number in a file where it can be read and written by
    various things (including hudson)
  * make oauth2.__version__ exist, rename VERSION to OAUTH_VERSION for
    clarity
  * debian/control -- build-dep pyflakes
  * fix pyflakes
  * build-dep requires python-coverage
  * switch from nosetests to the builtin test runner Just because it
    doesn't seem to currently use any feature of nosetest and this way
    we can reduce the dependencies by one. We'll feel free to switch it
    back to using nosetests (and add the dep to debian/control this
    time) if we want to use some extra feature of nose.
  * remove test failure which was inserted just to see if hudson was
    running the tests properly
  * Fix bug inserted by pyflakes inspired cleanup earlier -- it turns
    out that _get_version() wasn't dead code but was having a necessary
    side-effect. Add new method named _check_version() to be clearer
    about what it does compared to _get_version()
  * port tests from mox to mock because they were failing and I don't
    understand mox. now they are working. add mock to the python and
    debian deps. remove apparently left-over line of code that runs
    "sign()" at the end of checking a signature

python-oauth2 (1.2.1) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Joe Stump ]
  * Fixed a minor spelling error, added tests for
    oauth2.Error.__str__(), and added a test for build_xoauth_string().
  * Added a 'make test' command to the Makefile.
  * Added a bunch of new tests. 100% coverage has lapsed a bit. Fixing
    now.

  [ Ian Eure ]
  * Update deb rule in makefile to sign packages and move them to
    dist/deb.

  [ Joe Stump ]
  * Implemented a 'fix' for a bug in certain OAuth providers.
    http://bit.ly/aUrH43

  [ Ian Eure ]
  * Update packaging.
  * Fix version disparity.

  [ coulix ]
  * get normalised parameters should not take into account oauth_ params

  [ Mathias Herberts ]
  * Modified get_normalized_parameters so it does not encode '~' for
    full conformance with RFC 5849 section 3.6

  [ Peter Bengtsson ]
  * made it python 2.4 compatible

  [ Roderic Campbell ]
  * tok != token. con != consumer. May be confusing for people not
    actually reading the code.
